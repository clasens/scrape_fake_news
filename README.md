DESCRIPTION:
SnooSearch will scrape either the newest or top 1000 posts of a user-entered subreddit. The script will then compare the URLS of the posts with a keyword entered by the user, create a list (.csv) of the URLS with a match as well as the corresponding post score and number of comments. A pie chart showing the proportion of external URLS which matched the keyword, histogram and boxplot of comment numbers and scores, and a scatterplot sisplaying comment numbers and scores will all be generated.

TO USE:
Run the code in your console and enter valid inputs when prompted.
